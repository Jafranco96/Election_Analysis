# Election Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

A Colorado Board of Elections employee, Tom, has been tasked with auditing the election results for a congressional precinct. His final deliverable is a vote count report which should certify the congressional race. The report should display the total votes count, the total vote amounts and percentages by county, the largest county turnout, the total vote amounts and percentages by candidate, and the overall winning candidate by the popular vote. While this analysis could be done in Excel, Tom would like to develop an automated process so the same analysis procedure can be applied to future senatorial districts and local elections. Accordingly, Python was used to develop the automated algorithm for the congressional precinct analysis and which can be refactored for future use as well.

## Election-Audit Results

With the Python algorithm completed, which takes the raw vote data as a .csv file and outputs the certification summary to a .txt file, the analysis for the congressional precinct results was able to be fully automated. The certification summary, comprised of each component described previously, was as follows:

•	Total votes cast: **369,711**

•	Breakdown of total votes count and percentage of total votes for each precinct county:

    o	Jefferson County: 38,855 votes cast (10.5% of total votes)
  
    o	Denver County: 306,055 votes cast (82.8% of total votes)
  
    o	Arapahoe County: 24,801 votes cast (6.7% of total votes)

•	Largest County Turnout: **Denver County**

•	Breakdown of total votes count and percentage of total votes by candidate:

    o	Charles Casper Stockham: 85,213 votes cast (23.0% of total votes)
    
    o	Diana DeGette: 272,892 votes cast (73.8% of total votes)
    
    o	Raymon Anthony Doane: 11,606 votes cast (3.1% of total votes)

•	Winning candidate with vote count and percentage of total votes: **Diana DeGette**. 272,892 votes cast (73.8% of total votes)
